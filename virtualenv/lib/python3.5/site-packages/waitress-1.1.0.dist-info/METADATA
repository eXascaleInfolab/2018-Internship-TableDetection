Waitress is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very
acceptable performance.  It has no dependencies except ones which live in the
Python standard library.  It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python
2.7+ and Python 3.3+.  It is also known to run on PyPy 1.6.0+ on UNIX.  It
supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

For more information, see the "docs" directory of the Waitress package or
http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/ .


1.1.0 (2017-10-10)
------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Waitress now has a __main__ and thus may be called with ``python -mwaitress``

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Waitress no longer allows lowercase HTTP verbs. This change was made to fall
  in line with most HTTP servers. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/170

- When receiving non-ascii bytes in the request URL, waitress will no longer
  abruptly close the connection, instead returning a 400 Bad Request. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/162 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/64

1.0.2 (2017-02-04)
------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Python 3.6 is now officially supported in Waitress

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Add a work-around for libc issue on Linux not following the documented
  standards. If getnameinfo() fails because of DNS not being available it
  should return the IP address instead of the reverse DNS entry, however
  instead getnameinfo() raises. We catch this, and ask getnameinfo()
  for the same information again, explicitly asking for IP address instead of
  reverse DNS hostname. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/149 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/153

1.0.1 (2016-10-22)
------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- IPv6 support on Windows was broken due to missing constants in the socket
  module. This has been resolved by setting the constants on Windows if they
  are missing. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/138

- A ValueError was raised on Windows when passing a string for the port, on
  Windows in Python 2 using service names instead of port numbers doesn't work
  with `getaddrinfo`. This has been resolved by attempting to convert the port
  number to an integer, if that fails a ValueError will be raised. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/139


1.0.0 (2016-08-31)
------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Removed `AI_ADDRCONFIG` from the call to `getaddrinfo`, this resolves an
  issue whereby `getaddrinfo` wouldn't return any addresses to `bind` to on
  hosts where there is no internet connection but localhost is requested to be
  bound to. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/131 for more
  information.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python 2.6 is no longer supported.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- IPv6 support

- Waitress is now able to listen on multiple sockets, including IPv4 and IPv6.
  Instead of passing in a host/port combination you now provide waitress with a
  space delineated list, and it will create as many sockets as required.

  .. code-block:: python

	from waitress import serve
	serve(wsgiapp, listen='0.0.0.0:8080 [::]:9090 *:6543')

Security
~~~~~~~~

- Waitress will now drop HTTP headers that contain an underscore in the key
  when received from a client. This is to stop any possible underscore/dash
  conflation that may lead to security issues. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/80 and
  https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/jan/13/security/
